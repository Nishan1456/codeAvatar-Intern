I have used React.js as my framework and pure css.

Firstly I have created two pages and their components
1.SignUp.js with css
a.Leftbox.js with css
=> This section contains the left portion of signup page such as layouts

    b.Rightbox.js with css
         =>This section contains the right portion of signup page such as otp,logo,footer etc.

    c.Otp.js with css
        =>This section contains the otp portion

        In signup page, I displays the timer of 00:59 sec. After 59 sec resend msg pops out.

        After clicking verfy button, the transition changes and moves to the form.js

----------------------------------------**\*\*\*\***---------------------------------------------
2.Form.js with css
a.Mainform.js with css
=>This section contains the main form section of the form page

         I have created the step progress that changes as we trigger the next and previous button

-----------------------------------------\***\*\*\*\*\*\*\***-------------------------------------------

    Note:::::App.js contains the routing of signup and form pages

    I have tried my best to reflect my design as the provided UI/UX design
